FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever
============================

<!--View the project page <a href=http://wseemann.github.io/FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever/>here</a>.-->



Overview
--------

FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever is a reimplementation of Android's MediaMetadataRetriever class. The FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever class provides a unified interface for retrieving frame and meta data from an input media file and uses FFmpeg as its backend.

Key Features:
* ARM, ARMv7, x86, x86_64 and MIPS support
* Support for API 12+
* URL support (Unlike MediaMetadataRetriever, see: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=35794)

Supported protocols:
* file, http, https, mms, mmsh and rtmp

Supported formats (audio and video):
* aac, acc+, avi, flac, mp2, mp3, mp4, ogg, 3gp and more!

Additional support for:
* ICY Metadata (SHOUTcast metadata)

Using FMMR in your application (Android Studio)
------------

Add the following maven dependency to your project's `build.gradle` file:

    dependencies {
        compile 'com.github.ferdinandurban:FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever:1.0.11'
    }

or, if your application supports individual architectures extract the appropriate AAR file into you projects "libs" folder:

[Prebuilt AARs] (https://github.com/ferdinandurban/FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever/releases/download/v1.0.11/prebuilt-aars.zip)

(with HTTPS support)

[Prebuilt AARs with HTTPS] (https://github.com/ferdinandurban/FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever/releases/download/v1.0.9/prebuilt-aars-with-https.zip)

Demo Application
------------

A sample application that makes use of FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever can be downloaded [here] (https://github.com/ferdinandurban/FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever/blob/master/FMMRDemo.apk?raw=true). Note: The sample application is compiled with support for ALL available formats. This results in a larger library and APK. FFmpeg can be recompiled with a subset of codecs enabled for those wanting a smaller size.

Installation
------------

FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever relies on FFmpeg and native code. The build process
is complex and may be confusing for those unfamiliar the Android NDK. For this
reason I've precompiled AARs created by the build process and checked them
in [here] (https://github.com/ferdinandurban/FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever/releases/download/v1.0.11/prebuilt-aars.zip).
The modules are also included with the library. If you don't want to build the modules
you can simple unzip the prebuilt ones and copy them to your projects "libs" folder. (Note:
copy them to YOUR projects "libs" folder, NOT the "libs" folder located in
FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever/fmmr-library. Once this step is complete you can use the
library (See: Installation in Eclipse (Kepler)). If you want to compile the modules yourself
follow the Ant instructions listed below before attempting to use the library.

Download and install the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).
Download the [Android NDK](http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html).
Clone/Download/Fork the repo through GitHub or via (read-only)

    git clone https://github.com/ferdinandurban/FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever.git

### Ant

Note: The build instructions and scripts assume you are running Unix or Linux. Building
on other operating systems is currently not supported.

Execute the following in the FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever/fmmr-library/
directory (assuming /path/to/android_sdk/tools is in your PATH):

    android update project --path .

Open the newly created local.properties file and add the following lines:

    ndk.dir=<path to NDK>
    libs.dir=<path to target libs folder>

where <path to NDK> is the path to your Android NDK, for example:

    ndk.dir=/home/ferdinandurban/Android/android-ndk-r8e

and <path to target libs folder> is the path to the "libs" folder in the project that will use the
library, for example:

    libs.dir=/home/ferdinandurban/Android/MyAndroidDemo/libs

**Note:** If you wish to enable https support (for use with API 8+ only) navigate to FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever/fmmr-library/ and execute

    ant build-ffmpeg-with-ssl

To compile the library, navigate to FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever/fmmr-library/ and
execute

    ant clean debug

### Installation in Eclipse (Kepler)

The first step is to choose File > Import or right-click in the Project Explorer
and choose Import. If you don't use E-Git to integrate Eclipse with Git, skip
the rest of this paragraph. Choose "Projects from Git" as the import source.
From the Git page, click Clone, and enter the URI of this repository. That's the
only text box to fill in on that page. On the following pages, choose which
branches to clone (probably all of them) and where to keep the local checkout,
and then click Finish. Once the clone has finished, pick your new repository
from the list, and on the following page select 'Use the New Projects wizard'.

From here the process is the same even if you don't use E-Git. Choose 'Android
Project from Existing Code' and then browse to where you checked out 
FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever. Select the fmmr-library folder and click Finish.

Finally, to add the library to your application project, right-click your
project in the Package Explorer and select Properties. Pick the "Android" page,
and click "Add..." from the bottom half. You should see a list including the
FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever project as well as any others in your workspace.

Usage
------------

Sample code:

    FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever mmr = new FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever();
    mmr.setDataSource(mUri);
    mmr.extractMetadata(FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever.METADATA_KEY_ALBUM);
    mmr.extractMetadata(FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever.METADATA_KEY_ARTIST);
    Bitmap b = mmr.getFrameAtTime(2000000, FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever.OPTION_CLOSEST); // frame at 2 seconds
    byte [] artwork = mmr.getEmbeddedPicture();
    
    mmr.release();
